        "c": "Decreases",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "The right answer is (c). The radial heat transfer rate through hollow cylinder becomes constant if the ratio of outer radius to inner radius is constant.",
        "b": "The right answer is (c). The radial heat transfer rate through hollow cylinder decreases if the ratio of outer radius to inner radius increases. The heat transfer rate Q is inversely proportional to the natural logarithm of the ratio of the outer radius r2 to the inner radius r1 (i.e., ln(r2/r1)). This means that as the ratio r2/r1 increases, the value of ln(r2/r1) also increases. Since ln(r2/r1) is in the denominator of the equation, a increase in its value results in an decrease in the heat transfer rate Q.",
        "c": "Correct, The right answer is (c). The heat transfer rate Q is inversely proportional to the natural logarithm of the ratio of the outer radius r2 to the inner radius r1 (i.e., ln(r2/r1)). This means that as the ratio r2/r1 decreases, the value of ln(r2/r1) also decreases.

      "question": "When the thickness of insulation on a pipe exceeds the critical value the heat flow rate",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Increases",
        "b": "None of these",
        "c": "Remains constant",
        "d": "Decreases"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct, the right answer is (a). This is because as the insulation becomes thicker, the outer surface area of the insulation also increases. This larger surface area can radiate or convect more heat to the surroundings, which can increase the overall heat loss from the pipe.",
        "b": "The right answer is (a). When the thickness of insulation on a pipe exceeds the critical value the heat flow rate increases. This is because as the insulation becomes thicker, the outer surface area of the insulation also increases. This larger surface area can radiate or convect more heat to the surroundings, which can increase the overall heat loss from the pipe.",
        "c": "The right answer is (a). IF the thickness of insulation on a pipe exceeds or not exceeds the critical value, the heat flow rate should get increased or decreased but not remaining constant.",
        "d": "The right answer is (a). In general, increasing the thickness of the insulation increases its thermal resistance, which reduces the rate of heat transfer. However, when the thickness of the insulation exceeds a certain critical value, the heat flow rate can actually increase. This is because as the insulation becomes thicker, the outer surface area of the insulation also increases. This larger surface area can radiate or convect more heat to the surroundings, which can increase the overall heat loss from the pipe."
